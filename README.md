# ðŸ“š 100_Days_of_Deep_Learning (Unfinished)
A repository that contains deep learning code and application.  
Dedicated for someone who wants to learn about deep learning and neural network.

What you could expect from this repository :
* Predictions pipeline.
* Examples of neural network.
* Example of time series prediction.
* Example of natural language processing.
* Example of predicting numbers with neural networks.
* Example of image classification with neural networks.
* Advanced algorithm such as LSTM, Mask R-CNN and YOLO.

What you should not expect from this repository :
* Data cleaning.
* Basic regression algorithm.
* Free voucher at home depot.

ðŸ¥³ When you open this repository, pat yourself in the back since you are one step closer on understanding deep learning.

## Day 1, Hello World of Neural Network
In day 1, you will create a model that only have 1 layer of neural network with 1 neuron, you will also predict a number with a model that you have created.
