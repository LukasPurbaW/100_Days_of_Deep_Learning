### Day 1, Hello World of Neural Network
In day 1, you will create a model that only have 1 layer of neural network with 1 neuron, you will also predict a number with a model that you have created. [Start your journey by clicking this link.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LukasPurbaW/100_Days_of_Deep_Learning/blob/main/Day_1_Hello_World_of_Neural_Network.ipynb)

### Day 2, Activation Function
In day 2, types of activation functions will be introduced. Activation function is to create output by the weights of each neuron. [Start here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LukasPurbaW/100_Days_of_Deep_Learning/blob/main/Day_2_Activation_Function.ipynb)

### Day 3, Learning Rate and Gradient Descent
In day 3, the process of learning and effects of learning rate value would be explained using dummy data and graphs. [Start here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LukasPurbaW/100_Days_of_Deep_Learning/blob/main/Day_3_Learning_Rate_%26_Gradient_Descent.ipynb) 

### Day 4, Simple Workflow for Using Neural Network
In day 4, it's just a simple guideline on how to use neural network. [Start here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LukasPurbaW/100_Days_of_Deep_Learning/blob/main/Day_4_Simple_Prediction_Pipeline_(No_code).ipynb)

### Day 5, Using Neural Network for Churn Classification
In day 5, you will predict whether a customers will stop using the bank product or not with a fictional bank data.  
[Start here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LukasPurbaW/100_Days_of_Deep_Learning/blob/main/Day_5_ANN_for_Classification.ipynb)
 
### Day 6, Convolutional Neural Network
In day 6, you will learn about what is convolutional neural network that is oftenly used to classify images, and how does it works.
[Start here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/moswil/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/master/Practical_3a_Convolutional_Neural_Networks.ipynb)

### Day 7, Cat and Dog Classification with Neural Network
In day 7, you will get a hands on how to classify images with CNN from the methods that you have learned in previous code.
[Start here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lmoroney/dlaicourse/blob/master/Course%202%20-%20Part%202%20-%20Lesson%202%20-%20Notebook.ipynb#scrollTo=o-qUPyfO7Qr8)

### day 8, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
In day 8, you can learn about recurrent neural network, a neural network that can also store value from previous data. [Start here](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/cheatsheet-recurrent-neural-networks)

### day 9. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Algorithm
In day 9, you can learn more about LSTM, honestly the link is also as same as previous day, but here is an animation of LSTM algorithm. [Start here](https://towardsdatascience.com/animated-rnn-lstm-and-gru-ef124d06cf45)

### day 10, Stock Market Prediction with LSTM
In day 10, you will predict the price of stock market using LSTM, but be careful, every company in stock market have different data therefore you can't use one data for another company. [Start here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LukasPurbaW/10_Days_of_Deep_Learning/blob/main/Day_10_Stock_Price_Prediction_with_LSTM.ipynb)
