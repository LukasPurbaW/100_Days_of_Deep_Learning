## Day 1, Hello World of Neural Network
In day 1, you will create a model that only have 1 layer of neural network with 1 neuron, you will also predict a number with a model that you have created. [Start your journey by clicking this link.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LukasPurbaW/100_Days_of_Deep_Learning/blob/main/Day_1_Hello_World_of_Neural_Network.ipynb)

## Day 2, Activation Function
In day 2, types of activation functions will be introduced. Activation function is to create output by the weights of each neuron. [Start here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LukasPurbaW/100_Days_of_Deep_Learning/blob/main/Day_2_Activation_Function.ipynb)

## Day 3, Learning Rate and Gradient Descent
In day 3, the process of learning and effects of learning rate value would be explained using dummy data and graphs. [Start here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LukasPurbaW/100_Days_of_Deep_Learning/blob/main/Day_3_Learning_Rate_%26_Gradient_Descent.ipynb) 

## Day 4, Simple Workflow for Using Neural Network
In day 4, it's just a simple guideline on how to use neural network. [Start here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LukasPurbaW/100_Days_of_Deep_Learning/blob/main/Day_4_Simple_Prediction_Pipeline_(No_code).ipynb)

## Day 5, Using Neural Network for Classification
In day 5, The implementation of neural network in classification whether a customers will quit being customer or not with a fictional bank data.
